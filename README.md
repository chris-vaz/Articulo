# Articulo

High-Performance SaaS Automation Builder
Articulo is a robust, full-stack SaaS automation platform designed to streamline complex business workflows. Inspired by industry leaders like Zapier, 
Articulo allows users to create visual, logic-driven automations that connect disparate web services—such as Google Drive, Discord, Slack, and Notion—into a single, seamless engine.

Built with a modern, high-performance tech stack, this project demonstrates the power of visual programming and serverless architecture to handle real-time data synchronization and task execution.
